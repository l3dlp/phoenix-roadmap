# About the project

_The fable of the hummingbird tells the story of a tiny bird attempting to extinguish a raging forest fire by carrying droplets of water in its beak. Although the hummingbird's efforts seem insignificant compared to the magnitude of the blaze, the moral of the story is that even small actions can make a difference when everyone contributes their part._

This starts from a Medium chronicle I published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@l3dlp/about-unicoin-and-gnu-c572153ec67a).

**Don't hesitate to commit.**
Nothing is fundamentally real here, just a collective try-out.
